# I renamed the variable from reversed to reversed_str to avoid shadowing the built-in reversed function in Python.
# I used string slicing (s[::-1]) to reverse the string, which is a more efficient way to achieve the same result.

# The main issue is that the input function returns a string, so you need to convert the user input to an integer before comparing it to 18. Additionally, you should handle the case where the user enters non-numeric input. 
# 
# We store the user's input as age_str, which is a string.
# 
# We use age_str.isnumeric() to check if the input is a numeric string. If it is, we convert it to an integer using int(age_str) and then check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# 
# If both conditions are met, we return the age as an integer.If the input is not numeric or the age is less than 18, we return None to indicate an invalid age.
# 
# This code will handle both valid and invalid user inputs appropriately.

# The code provided reads a file, converts its content to uppercase, and then overwrites the original file with the uppercase content. If you want to create an uppercase version of the file while keeping the original file, you should use a different filename for the output. 
# 
# We modified the read_and_write_file function to accept two arguments: input_filename and output_filename(the name of the output file where the uppercase content will be saved)
# 
# In the main function, we specify both the input and output filenames. The input filename is set to "sample.txt," and the output filename is set to "sample_uppercase.txt".
# 
# When calling the read_and_write_file function in the main function, we provide both the input and output filenames as arguments.
# 
# This way, the original file is preserved, and the uppercase content is saved in a new file with the specified output filename.
